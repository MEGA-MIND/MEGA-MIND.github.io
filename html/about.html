					<h3>The Clean <span>!NDIA</span></h3>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>India is Beautiful but not Tidy. Imagine a Clean India, <span class="blue">#Swacch Bharat</span> with clean roads, clean parks and no smelly heaps of garbage, roadside.
					Do you know which is the largest and most powerful resource India has ? : Human resource  or putting it simple .. <strong>Population</strong>.<br>
					One might say Population itself is an issue . Well like the popular idiom <span class="orange">Iron Cuts Iron</span> , we believe that only a big problem can take on another big problem.
					</p><br><br>
					<h4>Incentivised Tech-bin</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					We introduce <strong>Incentivised Tech-bin</strong> where everyone who helps cleaning this country gets rewards. You just have to throw garbage into one special dustbin called the Techbin which you will find near you , get a token code and redeem the token code so generated on this site. <span class="blue">Everytime</span> you do it <span class="blue">Everytime</span> you get, <span class="green">More</span> time you do it the <span  class="green">More</span> you get !.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					India is much a better place with clean environment. Tech-bin brings you incentives way more valuable than cash redeems and offers. It gives you a <span class="orange">quality environment</span> to live
					in , a <span class="green">healthy environment</span> to live in. Stats say that India suffers about <strong>23 Lakh</strong> deaths due to pollution every year . Cleaning our environment is the first step towards fighting
					pollution. So tight your shoes and let's start .
